# Radar-SiCo2

This repository contains materials and projects for the Radar and SiCo2 classes.

This project aims to develop a real-time object detection and collision avoidance system using the IWR6843AOPEVM mmWave radar sensor. The system processes raw radar data to extract meaningful information about surroundings, estimate self-speed, detect obstacles, and trigger a braking mechanism when necessary.


## Repository Structure

- [Code](Code/): Contains algorithms created in python for testing.
  - [Algorithms](Code/Algorithms):
    - [ObjectDetectionRadarCompareData](Code/Algorithms/ObjectDetectionRadarCompareData.py)
  - [Radar](Code/Radar):
    - [Radar](Code/Radar/Radar):
- [Literature](Literature/): Contains literature resources.
  - [Notes](Literature/Notes):
  - [Radar](Literature/Radar):
  - [PDF Resources](Literature/PDF Resources):
- [Logs](Logs/): Contain logs captured in the vehicle.
  - [LogsPart1](Logs/LogsPart1):
  - [LogsPart2](Logs/LogsPart2):
  - [PlotLogs](Logs/PlotLogs):
    - [PlotLogs.py](Logs/PlotLogs/PlotLogs.py): Containg the file to visualize.
      - In line 397.
      - For the variable 'log_file', modify the folder "LogsPart2" to access the folder that you whish to obtain the data.
      - For the variable 'log_file', modify the folder "3_Target_straightLine_attempt1_log_2024-12-09.csv" to access the file that you whish to visualze
      - In line 407 & 410. Modify the parameter "doppler_threshold" for any threshold that you want. It will mean that points below that threshold will appear in one plot or the other.
        - The program will provide 2 option.
          - The data will be able to be seen in 2 different plots. One for stationary data (All data below a Doppler speed of 0.1 mps). The later is data that is considered as actual data.
          - Visualze line [1]. This one as the name states, will use the timestamp stored in the files to show a real life data-motion as it was recorded.
          - Visualize all data [2]. This one as the name states, will only put in a 3d plot all the recorded data.
